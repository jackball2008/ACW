To use gxbase, you need only include as follows:

  #include "GXBase.h"
  using namespace gxbase;

The other header files within this directory are
automatically included by GXBase as required.

Note: the following files are not part of GXBase per se,
but are provided to ensure that the OpenGL extension
headers match the version that the library was built with.
  glext.h
  wglext.h

The following header files are auto-generated:
  glex.h
  glexfp.h
